<ul>
  <li>What is Newton&rsquo;s first law?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>A body at rest remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion

    it? See Figure 5.9.

    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Nonzero.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The _________ the mass, the smaller the acceleration produced by a given
    force. This means that acceleration and mass are inversely proportional.

      <li>The same direction as the net force.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span style="background-color:#ffff00">On pdf version page 215, and
    Example 5.3 on pdf version page 221. From the errata: &ldquo;Beginning on
    page 219 an incorrect explanation for the forward motion of an automobile
    is given and then repeated. The last paragraph states that the friction
    force opposes the forward motion and the "engine force". The engine force
    is not an external force and in fact, it is the frictional force that
    propels the car forward. The frictional force opposes the drag forces and
    these are balanced for a car with constant velocity. Example 5.1b page 220
    repeats this inaccuracy. Example 5.3 on page 225 also repeats the notion
    that the friction between the road and the tires is backwards for a forward
    moving and forward accelerating car. This is also incorrect. The only time
    the friction is backwards is if the car is braking to a halt. These
    sections and examples should be completely rewritten. &ldquo;</span></li>
  <li>What is Newton&rsquo;s second law in component form?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Equation 5.5.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Understand Examples 5.5 &ndash; 5.7.</li>
  <li>What is momentum?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Equation 5.7.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>5.4 Mass and Weight</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is weight?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Force due to gravity in a mass.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is weight the same thing as mass? How are they related?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>No. Mass doesn&rsquo;t change, weight is on object&rsquo;s mass times
        its acceleration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you were on another planet, would your weight or mass change? Neither?
    Both?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Mass stays the same because it is intrinsic to the body. The weight
        changes because the acceleration due to gravity changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What does it mean for an object to be in free fall?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>The net external force equals its&rsquo; weight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mass is an _____________ property of matter.
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Intrinsic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>5.5 Newton&rsquo;s Third Law</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is Newton&rsquo;s third law?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Equation 5.10.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the third law loosely referred to as?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Action reaction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the discussion of the swimmer and Figure 5.16, the magnitude of what
    force is equal to the magnitude of the feet on the wall force?
    <ul>
      <li>Wall on the feet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the reaction force acting on the rocket?
    <ul>
      <li>Thrust</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are two important features of Newton&rsquo;s third law?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>The forces exerted (the action and reaction) are always equal in
        magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces are acting on
        different bodies or systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Understand Example 5.10 and 5.11 to understand how to choose a system and
    action-reaction forces.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.6 Common Forces</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is a normal force?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>The force supporting the weight of an object, or a load, that is
        perpendicular to the surface of contact between the load and its
        support; the surface applies this force to an object to support the
        weight of the object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the vector form of the normal force of an object resting on a
    horizontal surface? Its magnitude?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Equation 5.11 and 5.12.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 5.12, why is the normal force pointing at an angle as opposed
    to opposite the weight vector?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>It is perpendicular to the surface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using a tilted coordinate system is often convenient. See Figure
  5.23.</li>
  <li>What is tension?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>A pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such
        as a rope or cable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 5.13, is the majority of the tension in the horizontal or
    vertical direction?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Horizontal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Friction is a __________ force opposing motion.
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Resistive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What restoring force do springs experience? What is k? The equation in
    the middle of pdf page 245 is called Hooke's Law and is important even
    though it isn't numbered. 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>F = - kx. K is the spring constant, it represents the springs
        stiffness.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the difference between real and fictitious forces?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Real forces have a physical origin. Fictitious forces arise because
        the observer is accelerating.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span style="background-color:#ffff00">At the top of pdf version page
    246, in Real Forces and Inertial Frame the errata contain the explanation
    &ldquo;I think the Coriolis force discussion gets the wrong sign. I think
    the following statements in the book are wrong because they say the
    satellite feels a force to the west (should be east, the satellite curves
    to the east): "... if a satellite is heading due north above Earth&rsquo;s
    Northern Hemisphere, then to an observer on Earth, it will appear to
    experience a force to the west that has no physical origin. Instead, Earth
    is rotating toward the east and moves east under the satellite. In
    Earth&rsquo;s frame, this looks like a westward force on the satellite ...
    In the example of the satellite, the reaction force would have to be an
    eastward force on Earth." The issue: the Coriolis force in the northern
    hemisphere is to the east (not west) for a satellite moving north. Thus
    ocean currents in the northern hemisphere are clockwise. Figure 10 shows a
    counterclockwise hurricane, but that is because it is a low pressure storm
    (high pressure storms rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere). &ldquo;
    How should this be written in the reading guide?</span></li>
  <li>What question do you ask to determine if a force is real or fictitious?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>&ldquo;What is the reaction force?&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>5.7 Drawing Free-Body Diagrams</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem-solving strategy for drawing free-body diagrams?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Draw the object under consideration. At first, you may want to draw a
        circle around the object of interest to be sure you focus on labeling
        the forces acting on the object. We often place this point at the
        origin of an xy-coordinate system. Include all forces that act on the
        object, representing these forces as vectors. Consider the types of
        forces (normal force, friction, tension, and spring force, weight
        applied force). Do not include the net force on the object. Convert the
        free-body diagram into a more detailed diagram showing the x- and
        y-components of a given force. If there are two or more objects, in the
        problem draw a separate free-body diagram for each object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 5.16, is the acceleration of mass 1 equal to the acceleration
    of mass 2? Why?
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Yes, because they are connected with rope.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
