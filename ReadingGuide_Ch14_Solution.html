<h1>Chapter 14 &ndash; Fluid Mechanics</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>- What are some examples of how pressure effects everyday life? <span
id="ans">Weather, ears popping during airplane takeoff, scuba divers getting
nitrogen bubbles in their blood, buoyancy. </span></p>

<p></p>

<h3>14.1 &ndash; Fluids, Density and Pressure</h3>

<p>- What is a fluid? <span id="ans">Liquid or gas, yields to shearing forces.
</span></p>

<p>- What is density? <span id="ans">Mass per unit volume. Characteristic of an
object. Equation 14.1. </span></p>

<p>- Common densities are listed in Table 14.1. </p>

<p>- What is specific gravity? <span id="ans">Ratio of the density of a
material to the density of water at 4 degrees Celsius. </span></p>

<p><span id="prob">- The left hand side of the equation at the top of pdf page
697 should read specific gravity.</span></p>

<p>- What is pressure? <span id="ans">Force per unit area. Equation
14.3.</span> </p>

<p>- What is the SI unit of pressure? What other base units is it equivalent
to? <span id="ans">Pascal. 1 Pa = 1N/m^2. </span></p>

<p>- What equation shows how pressure changes with depth? What is p_0? <span
id="ans">Equation 14.4. The atmospheric pressure.</span> </p>

<p>- Example 14.1 (What force must a Dam Withstand?) shows how to apply
Equation 14.4. Notice that the force doesn't depend on the surface area of the
water. </p>

<p>- Equation 14.8 shows how pressure changes with fluid depth. This equation
is integrated to obtain Equation 14.4. </p>

<p>- The equation at the bottom of pdf page 702 shows how pressure varies with
height. The y axis starts at the ground and goes straight up into space. </p>

<p>- For an object in a fluid, what direction does the fluid pressure point?
<span id="ans">Perpendicular. </span></p>

<h3>14.2 &ndash; Measuring Pressure</h3>

<p>- What is gauge pressure? What is absolute pressure? <span id="ans">The
pressure read by a gauge, pressure relative to atmosphere. Absolute pressure
adds atmospheric pressure to gauge pressure.</span> </p>

<p>- What equation relates gauge pressure to absolute pressure? <span
id="ans">Equation 14.11. </span></p>

<p>- See Figure 14.12 and 14.13 to understand how a manometer and barometer
work. </p>

<p><span id="prob">- There are many errors in Table 14.3, Look at appendix B to
see proper conversion factors. </span></p>

<h3>14.3 &ndash; Pascal's Principle and Hydraulics</h3>

<p>- What is Pascal's principle? When a change is pressure is applied to an
enclosed fluid, it is transmitted undimished to all portions of the fluid and
the walls of its containers.</p>

<p>- What equation relates forces and areas in hydraulic systems? <span
id="ans">Equation 14.12. </span></p>

<h3>14.4 &ndash; Archimedes' Principle and Buoyancy</h3>

<p>- What is buoyant force? <span id="ans">The upward force on any object in a
fluid. </span></p>

<p>- What is Archimedes' principle? <span id="ans">The buoyant force on an
object equals the weight of the fluid it displaces.</span></p>

<p>- What equations relate the fraction submerged to volume displaced to the
volume of an object and density of an object to density of a fluid? <span
id="ans">The equation in the middle of pdf page 715 and the equation at the top
of pdf page 716. </span></p>

<h3>14.5 - Fluid Dynamics</h3>

<p>- What is an ideal fluid? <span id="ans">A fluid with negligible viscosity.
</span></p>

<p>- What is viscosity? <span id="ans">Measure of the internal friction in a
fluid. </span></p>

<p>- What is the difference between laminar and turbulent flow? <span
id="ans">laminar - smooth streamlines, Turbulent - streamlines are irregular
and change overtime. </span></p>

<p>- What is the equation for volume flow rate? <span id="ans">Equation 14.13.
</span></p>

<p>- What is the equation of continuity? What does it mean? <span
id="ans">Equation 14.14. The flow rate must be the same at all points along the
pipe. </span></p>

<p>- From Example 14.5 (Calculating Fluid Speed through a Nozzle), how is speed
related to the radius of the pipe? <span id="ans">They are inversely related.
</span></p>

<p>- Equation 14.15 is the mass flow continuity equation. </p>

<h3>14.6 - Bernoulli's Equation </h3>

<p>- What is Bernoulli's equation? <span id="ans">Equation 14.16. </span></p>

<p>- What is Bernoulli's principle? <span id="ans">Bernoulli's equation at
constant depth. </span></p>

<p>- Examples 14.6 and 14.7 show how to apply Bernoulli's principle. </p>

<h3>14.7 Viscosity and Turbulence</h3>

<p>- What is turbulence? <span id="ans">Fluid flow in which layers mix together
via eddies and swirls. </span></p>

<p>- What is the equation for viscosity?<span id="ans">Equation 14.17.
</span></p>

<p>- Table 14.4 shows viscosities for various fluids. </p>

<p>- What equation is Poiseuilles law of resistance? <span id="ans">Equation
14.18. </span></p>

<p>- What equation is Poiseuilles law for laminar flow? <span id="ans">Equation
14.19. </span></p>

<p>- What is a Reynold's number? What number corresponds to laminar flow?
Turbulent flow? <span id="ans">A measure of flow. Equation 14.20. Laminar -
number below 2000. Turbulent - number above 3000. </span></p>
