<h1>Chapter 13 &ndash; Gravitation</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>- Gravity is an action-at-a-distance force, what does this mean? <span
id="ans">Objects exert a gravitational force on one another without physical
contact and that force goes to zero at infinite distance.</span></p>

<p>- In general, the examples in this chapter are good to see how to put in
typical numbers into the relevant equations. </p>

<h3>13.1 &ndash; Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation</h3>

<p>- What is the equation for Newton's Law of Gravitation? <span
id="ans">Equation 13.1. </span></p>

<p>- What is the driection of the force? <span id="ans">Along a line between
the centers of m_1 and m_2.</span></p>

<p>- What is the universal gravitational constant? <span
id="ans">G=6.67e^(-11)Nm^2/kg^2. </span></p>

<p>- What is the problem solving strategy for solving problems involving
Newton's Law of Gravitation? <span id="ans">1. Identify the two masses, one or
both, for which you wish to find the gravitational force. 2. Draw a free-body
diagram, sketching the force acting on each mass and indicating the distance
between their centers of mass. 3. Apply Newton&rsquo;s second law of motion to
each mass to determine how it will move.</span></p>

<h3>13.2 &ndash; Gravitation Near Earth's Surface</h3>

<p>- What is the equation for g? <span id="ans">Equation 13.2.</span> </p>

<p>- Equation 13.3 shows how the rotation of the Earth effects the acceleration
due to gravity. This is shown in Example 13.5 (Zero Apparent Weight).</p>

<p>- What is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration on the surface of
the Earth? How does it compare to g?<span id="ans">a_c = 0.0337 m/s^2 = 0.34% *
g. </span></p>

<p>- Is the magnitude of g inside Earth larger, smaller or the same than the
magnitude of g on the surface? What equation shows this? <span
id="ans">Smaller. Equation in middle of pdf page 647.</span> </p>

<p>- What is the acceleration due to gravity at the center of any spheical
planet? <span id="ans">Zero. </span></p>

<h3>13.3 &ndash; Gravitational Potential Energy and Potential Energy</h3>

<p>- Equation 13.4 shows gravitational potential energy. What does U go to when
r goes to infinity? <span id="ans1">Zero.</span> </p>

<p>- What is escape velocity? <span id="ans">The minimum velocity required to
escape the surface of a planet. Equation 13.6.</span></p>

<h3>13.4 &ndash; Satellite Orbits and Energy</h3>

<p>- What are the equations for orbital speed and period? <span
id="ans">Equations 13.7 and 13.8.</span></p>

<p>- What is the problem solving strategy for solving problems involving orbits
and conservation of energy? <span id="ans">Determine whether the equations for
speed, energy, or period are valid for the problem at hand. 2. To start from
first principles, draw a free-body diagram and apply Newton&rsquo;s law of
gravitation and Newton&rsquo;s</span></p>

<p><span id="second">second law. 3. Along with the definitions for speed and
energy, apply Newton&rsquo;s second law of motion to the bodies of interest.
</span></p>

<p>- What is the equation for total energy in circular orbits? <span
id="ans">Equation 13.9.</span></p>

<h3>13.5 - Kepler's Laws of Planetary motion</h3>

<p>- What is Kepler's first law? <span id="ans">Every planet moves along an
ellipse, with the Sun at one focus. </span></p>

<p>- What is Kepler's second law? <span id="ans">A planet sweeps out equal
areas in equal times. The areal velocity is constant. </span></p>

<p>- What is Kepler's third law? <span id="ans">Equation 13.11. </span></p>

<h3>13.6 - Tidal Forces </h3>

<p>- What is a tidal force? <span id="ans">Difference between the gravitational
force at the center of a body and that at any other location on the
body.</span></p>

<p>- What are spring and neap tides? <span id="ans">See Figure 13.22. Spring -
When Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned and the tidal effects add. Neap - When
the Earth, Moon and Sun cause the smallest tides. </span></p>

<h3>13.7 Einstein's Theory of Gravity</h3>

<p>- What is the principle of equivalence? <span id="ans">Part of general
relativity that states that there is no difference between free fall and being
weightless, or a uniform gravitational field and uniform acceleration.
