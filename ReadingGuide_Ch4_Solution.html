<p><strong>Chapter 4: MOTION IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<p style="line-height:1em;">-Why do we study motion in two and three dimension?
<span id="ans">To give complete description of the kinematics.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:1em;">-What types of motion in 2D we would learn in this
chapter? <span id="ans">Projectile and circular motion.</span></p>

<p><strong>4.1 Displacement and Velocity Vecotr</strong></p>

<p>-where are the displacement and velocity in two and three dimensions
extended from? <span id="ans">From one dimensional motion</span></p>

<p><strong>Displacement Vector:</strong></p>

<p>-What must be established before we describe the motion in two and three
dimension? <span id="ans">Coordinate systems and a convention for
axes</span></p>

<p>-How can be position vector written in terms of unit vector notation?<span
id="ans">(Equation: 4.2)</span></p>

<p>-Is the co-ordinate system shown in Fig.4.2 right handed or left handed?
<span id="ans">Right handed</span></p>

<p>-How is the displacement vector obtained from position vectors? <span
id="ans">Final - Initial position</span></p>

<p>-Look how the total displacement of particle calculated from adding
individual displacements in Brownian motion example (Example 4.2).</p>

<p><strong>Velocity Vector:</strong></p>

<p>-How do you define instantaneous velocity vector? <span id="ans">Derivative
of position vector (Equation 4.4)</span></p>

<p>-What happens to the velocity vector when &#x2206;t approaches to zero in
Fig.4.7? <span id="ans">Becomes tangent to the path of the particle</span></p>

<p>-How is average velocity found in two or three dimension? <span
id="ans">Ratio of change in position to time interval(Equation 4.7)</span></p>

<p>-Look how the instantaneous velocity and average velocity found from
position function in Example 4.3. Also, look how the speed is found taking
magnitude of velocity.</p>

<p>-Are the components of the position and velocity (in unit vector notation)
vector depend on one another? <span id="ans">NO</span></p>

<p>-What is independence of motion? <span id="ans">Treating the horizontal and
vertical components of motion separately</span></p>

<p>-Notice Fig.4.8 proves the independence of the vertical and horizontal
motion by showing the two balls with same verticle velocity but different
horizontal velocity travel same verticle distance in a given time.</p>

<p>-Why is the resolution of two-dimensional motion into perpendicular
components possible? <span id="ans">The components are independent.</span></p>

<p><span id="prob">Error: While writing derivative of vector in the pdf
version, the "<em>d"</em> of the derivative and vector are far apart. For eg.
in equation 4.4.</span></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>4.2 Acceleration Vector:</strong></p>

<p>-How is the instantaneous acceleration in two or three dimension found from
velocity function? <span id="ans">Derivative of velocity vector(Equation
4.9)</span></p>

<p>-How is the instantaneous acceleration in two or three dimension found from
position function? <span id="ans">Double derivative of position
vector.(Equation 4.10)</span></p>

<p>-Look how the velocity is find out from the derivative of position function
and acceleration calculated from derivative of velocity in Example 4.5. </p>

<p>-There are two sets of Kinematic equations in for two dimensions .(Equation
4.11 &ndash; 4.18). This can be futher extended to third set if you consider
motion in 3D.</p>

<p>-While solving the 2D motion, we list components of all the known varibles
and use the two independent sets of the kinematic equations (in two directions)
to find the unkonwn varibles. Finally, we find resultant from the two
components. Look how the skier motion is analyzed in Example 4.6</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>4.3 Projectile Motion:</strong></p>

<p>-What is projectile motion? <span id="ans">Motion of an object projected
into the air, subjected only to gravitational force.</span></p>

<p>-What are some examples of projectile motion? <span id="ans">Fireworks,
motion of any ball in sports.</span></p>

<p>-What is projectile and trajectory? <span id="ans">An object in projectile
motion. The path of projectile.</span></p>

<p>-Why can the motions along perpendicular axes be analyzed independently?
<span id="ans">because they are independent</span></p>

<p>-What is the key to analyzing two-dimensional projectile motion? <span
id="ans">Break down into two motion: along horizontal and vertical
axis.</span></p>

<p>-What must be included to describe projectile motion completely? <span
id="ans">Velocity, acceleration and displacement.</span></p>

<p>-Why the initial velocity in X-direction is equal to final velocity in
X-direction? <span id="ans">The gravity is vertical and acceleration along X-
direction is zero</span>.</p>

<p>-What is the magnitude of the horizontal component of acceleration? <span
id="ans">Zero.</span></p>

<p>-There are two sets of kinematic equations used for projectile motions. The
one along horizontal (X-axis) direction has acceleration zero while along
verticle direction (Y-axis) has acceleration is "<em>-g</em>". Look at the set
of equations to analyze the projectile motion. (Equation 4.19 to 4.23)</p>

<p>-Problem-solving strategy: Seperate the varibales into two components (X-
and Y-). Solve them with two different sets of kinematic equations. Recombine
the components at last. (Same as that of motion in 2D in earlier section. Keep
in mind of the values of acceleration in two components. Also, keep in mind
that the Y-component of the velocity at the heighest level is zero.)</p>

<p>-Analyze how the projectile motion can be breakdown into two components and
how the velocity of the projectile changes along the trajectory in Fig.
4.12.</p>

<p>-What is the mathematical expression for time of flight and how it is
derived? <span id="ans">(Equation 4.24)</span></p>

<p>-What is the condition for the validity of equation 4.24? <span
id="ans">Projectile should land in same elevation.</span></p>

<p>-What are the mathematical expressions for trajectory and range of a
projectile and how are they derived? <span id="ans">(Equation 4.25 and
4.26)</span></p>

<p>-Compare the time of flight and range of a projectile on earth and on moon
if they are thrown with same velocity at same angle. <span id="ans">Both will
be six times on moon than that on Earth.</span></p>

<p>-What is the angle for the maximum range of the projectile? <span
id="ans">45 degree</span></p>

<p>-Is the range larger or smaller than predicted by Equation 4.26 when the
range is comparable with earth&rsquo;s circumference? <span
id="ans">Larger</span></p>

<p>-What is the required initial horizontal velocity for a projectile to keep
on orbiting around earth? <span id="ans">8000 m/s</span></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>4.4 Uniform Circular Motion:</strong></p>

<p>-What is uniform circular motion? Give examples. <span id="ans">Where an
object travels in a circular motion with a constant speed. Eg. Hands of a
watch</span></p>

<p>-When is it possible to have constant speed but non-zero acceleration? <span
id="ans">If it moves along a curved trajectory</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for centripetal acceleration and what is its
direction? <span id="ans">Equation 4.27. Towards center</span></p>

<p>-How is the meaning of the term &ldquo;centripetal&rdquo;? <span
id="ans">Centrum: center, peter: seek i.e. center seeking</span></p>

<p>-Values of some typical centripetal acceleration (Table 4.1)</p>

<p>-How can the position vector, velocity and acceleration for a particle
moving in circular motion be expressed in terms of its components? <span
id="ans">(Equation 4.28, 4.29 and 4.30)</span></p>

<p>-What is angular frequency? What is its unit? <span id="ans">Angle traversed
per unit time. Unit: radian per sec.</span></p>

<p>-What is the &ldquo;period&rdquo; of the motion? How do you calculate it?
<span id="ans">Time to complete one revolution</span>.</p>

<p>-What are the magnitude and direction of velocity and acceleration for
circularly moving object? <span id="ans">Velocity: A, tangential to the circle
at the location of particle. Acceleration: A^2, towards the origin (opposite of
position vector)</span></p>

<p>-Look how the angular speed is obtained from linear speed and hence used to
find the positon of proton in example 4.11.</p>

<p>-What happens when the speed of particle in a circular motion changes? Give
some examples. <span id="ans">There would be additional acceleration in the
direction tangential to circle. Eg. Top changing its spin rate.</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression and direction for tangential acceleration? <span
id="ans">(Equation 4.31)</span></p>

<p>-How is the total, tangential and centripetal acceleration related? <span
id="ans">Total = tangential + centripetal</span></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>4.5 Relative Motion in One and Two Dimensions:</strong></p>

<p>-Look how we construct the vector equation relating to reative motion in
Fig. 4.24. Notice subscript are arranged.</p>

<p>-How can the relative velocity (acceleration) between two objects be found
in one and two dimension? <span id="ans">(Equation 4.35 to 4.37)</span></p>

<p>-Look how the vector equation is used to fin the motion of a car relative to
a truck is explained in example 4.13.</p>
