<p><strong>Chapter 1 – Units and Measurements</strong></p>

<p><em></em></p>

<p>The following describes the topics to watch out for and skills to master as
you read through Chapter 1 and the Appendices.</p>

<p>Today, we will explore units and measurement covered in Chapter 1. Physics
and all of the other sciences are inextricably connected with the ability to
measure and quantify phenomena. This course will develop how we expect physical
quantities to be related, but all the understanding that we think we have
derives from experiments. The more accurately and precisely we can measure
distance, time or mass (and many other quantities) determines what we can
ultimately infer about the Universe.</p>

  <li>What force acts on the Whirlpool galaxy as well as Earth?</li>

  <p id="ans">Gravity</p>
  <li>What law ties together food calories, batteries, heat, light, and watch springs? What does it state?
    <p>Conservation of energy. Energy can change form but is never lost.</p>
