<p><strong>Chapter 1 – Units and Measurements</strong></p>

<p><em></em></p>

<p>The following describes the topics to watch out for and skills to master as
you read through Chapter 1 and the Appendices.</p>

<p>Today, we will explore units and measurement covered in Chapter 1. Physics
and all of the other sciences are inextricably connected with the ability to
measure and quantify phenomena. This course will develop how we expect physical
quantities to be related, but all the understanding that we think we have
derives from experiments. The more accurately and precisely we can measure
distance, time or mass (and many other quantities) determines what we can
ultimately infer about the Universe.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>What can be used to describe atoms as well as galaxies? <span
    id="ans">Physics.</span> </li>
</ul>

<p id="ans"></p>

<p><strong>1.1 The Scope and Scale of Physics</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Physics is devoted to the understanding of what? <span id="ans">All
    natural phenomena which means all natural things that occur</span></li>
  <li>What force acts on the Whirlpool galaxy as well as Earth? <span
    id="ans">Gravity</span></li>
  <li>What law ties together food calories, batteries, heat, light, and watch
    springs? What does it state? </li>

  <p id="ans">Conservation of energy. Energy can change form but is never
  lost.</p>
  <li>Describe the scope of physics. </li>

  <p id="ans">Describes the most basic understanding of phenomena. Describes
  the interactions of matter, space, and time.</p>
  <li>Physics can be used to describe what aspects of smartphones? </li>

  <p id="ans">Electricity flow through circuits and GPS.</p>
  <li>What other disciplines use physics? </li>

  <p id="ans">Chemistry, engineering, architecture, geology, biophysics,
  geophysics, biological sciences, medical diagnostics, medical therapy</p>
</ul>

<p>•What is an order of magnitude?</p>

<p id="ans">The size of a quantity as it related to a power of 10. </p>

<p>•What is the order of magnitude of 297,395?</p>

<p id="ans">Log10(297,395) = 5.47. So the order of magnitude is 10^6. </p>

<p>•Is an order of magnitude is designed to more like an exact quantity or a
ballpark estimate? <span id="comm">Q too open ended originally</span></p>

<p id="ans">A ballpark estimate. </p>

<p>•READING EXERCISE : Use order of magnitude arguments and Figure 1.4 to
determine how many electrons are in a person. <span id="comm">this is a nice
example but for things that aren't strictly in the reading like this indicate
with a tag like READING EXERCISE</span></p>

<p id="ans">m_elec = 10^-10 kg. m_human = 10^2 kg. 10^2kg/10^-30 kg = 10^32
electrons/human </p>

<p>•Describe the relationships among models, theories, and laws.</p>

<p id="ans">model - representation of something that is often too difficult to
display directly, justified by experimental tests, it is only accurate in
describing certain aspects of a physical system.theory - testable explanation
for patterns in nature supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple
times.All scientific laws and theories are valid until a counterexample is
observed. law - concise language that describes a generalized pattern in nature
supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments.</p>

<p></p>

<p>•What determines the validity of a theory? <span id="comm">this answer one
was fine but for the first study guide I wanted answers to be a little more
spelled out</span></p>

<p id="ans">Experimental tests produce results that confirm the theory. </p>

<p>•Can the validity of a model be limited or must it be universally valid?
How does this compare with the required validity of a theory or a law?</p>

<p id="ans">Models only need be accurate in describing certain aspects of a
physical system. A theory or law must be valid in all situations. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>1.2 Units and Standards</strong></p>

<p>•How is a physical quantity defined?</p>

<p id="ans">Characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or
calculated from other measurements. </p>

<p>•What is a unit?</p>

<p id="ans">Standards used for expressing and comparing measurements. </p>

<p>•What is the difference between SI and English units?</p>

<p id="ans">Si units – international system of units that scientists in most
countries have agreed to use (i.e. m, L, g). English units – system of units
that is used widely only in the US (i.e. ft, gal, lbs) </p>

<p>-What are base quantities and units? How do they differ from derived
quantities and units? <span id="comm">note visibility hidden does not change
spacing for the &lt;p&gt; class try making this a &lt;li&gt; to see if that can
fix the spacing when hidden (OK if it's all on one line) if not try splitting
them shorter?</span> <span id="ans">Base quantity - physical quantity chosen by
convention andpractical considerations such that all other physical quantities
can beexpressed as algebraic combinations of them. Base unit - standard
forexpressing the measurement of a base quantity within a particular system of
units; defined by a particular procedure used to measure the corresponding
basequantity derived quantity - physical quantity defined using
algebraiccombinations of base quantities. Derived units - units that can be
calculatedusing algebraic combinations of the fundamental units. </span></p>

<p>•What are the SI base units of length, mass, time, and thermodynamic
temperature?</p>

<p id="ans">m kg, s, K. </p>

<p>•Is area a base or derived quantity?</p>

<p id="ans">Derived. </p>

<p>•How is the second defined in the metric system now? <span id="ans">time
it takes for certain number (~9B) vibrations of a Cesium atom</span></p>

<p>•How is the meter defined in the metric system now? <span
id="ans">distance light travels in 1/(light speed) of a second</span></p>

<p>•How is the kg defined in the metric system now?<span id="ans">based on
mass of a standard object at NIST</span> </p>

<p>•Understand Table 1.2 and how to convert the unit prefixes into numbers
that you can plug into a calculator (e.g. converting mm to m)</p>

<p>•NOTE: You should be able to express a quantity given in scientific
notation to a more readable version that uses an SI unit prefix (e.g.
converting W to MW).</p>

<p>•Conversion factors are given in Appendix B.</p>

<p>•Go through example 1.1 (Using Metric Prefixes) to understand how to
choose metric prefixes.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>1.3 Unit Conversion</strong></p>

<p>•What ratio (what divided by what?) is a conversion factor?<span
id="comm">another examp: little less open-ended</span></p>

<p id="ans">a ratio how many of one unit are equal to another unit: for example
the first unit divided by the equal number of the other</p>

<p>•How should the conversion factor be chosen/mathematically arranged ?
<span id="ans">so the old unit cancels out</span></p>

<p>•READING EXERCISE: Use conversion factors to express the value of a given
quantity in different units by going through the examples.</p>

<p>•Conversion factors are given in Appendix B.</p>

<p>•Be sure to cancel units correctly when doing conversions and be certain
that the final answer is in the right units.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>1.4 Dimensional Analysis</strong></p>

<p>•What are some examples of dimensions?</p>

<p id="ans">time, mass, mass squared (M^2), 1/length (1/L) ... </p>

<p>•If a quantity is dimensionless, what are its units?</p>

<p id="ans">The quantity has no units. </p>

<p>•What does it mean for an equation to be dimensionally consistent?</p>

<p id="ans">every term has the same dimensions </p>
<!--<p>•Understand the examples in order to appreciate the usefulness of
dimensional analysis.</p>-->

<p>•NOTE: Dimensional analysis can help you remember the correct form of an
equation.</p>

<p>•Is the equation v=a*t dimensionally consistent?</p>

<p id="ans">Yes. [v] = [L]/[T] = [L]/[T^2] * [T] = [L]/[T]. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>1.5 Estimates and Fermi Calculations</strong></p>

<p>•What is a Fermi calculation? (This section of the book will not be
covered in class)</p>

<p id="ans">An estimation. </p>

<p><strong>1.6 Significant Figures</strong></p>

<p>•What is the difference between accuracy and precision?</p>

<p id="ans">Accuracy - how close a measurement is to the accepted reference
value for that measurement. Precision - how close the agreement is between
repeated independent measurements </p>

<p><span id="prob">•Compared to the book definition, uncertainty is better
defined as an estimate of how much measured values may deviate from the true
value; Thus the proper definition of uncertainty could include some estimate of
possible discrepancy as well as an estimate of how much measurements may
deviate from one another</span></p>

<p>• What is discrepancy or measurement error <span id="comm">? Previously:
What is uncertainty? What is discrepancy? This would've been fine but for the
problematic book def of uncertainty</span> <span id="ans">Difference between
the measured value and an expected value. </span></p>

<p>•Understand how to calculate percent uncertainty by understanding Example
1.7 (calculating percent uncertainty: a bag of apples).</p>

<p>•Why are significant figures useful?</p>

<p id="ans">They are used to express the precision of a measuring tool used to
measure a value </p>

<p>We assume that you already have some familiarity with methods of using
significant figures, and that you will be able to apply those rules. However,
the rules are not always used in this class. Except on LON-CAPA it is safest to
give answers using those rules; it may not always be required though, so it's a
good idea to ask if in doubt. </p>

<p>•Our LON-CAPA homework assignments will usually ask you to enter 3
significant figures for your answers. You need to understand how to do this
correctly. A number like 0.001 has only 1 significant figure, not 3 or 4
because the leading zeros are not significant. The way to see this is to write
it in Scientific Notation (0.001 = 1 x 10^-3 -- there is only 1 significant
figure in that). Significant figures arise because our knowledge is limited by
what we can measure and in real life, we can only measure quantities to a
certain level of precision (that depends on the measuring tools we have). Some
physical quantities have been measured to many decimal places, but only by
means of exquisitely careful measurement with the absolutely best tools. With
the tools you'll have in lab you'll rarely be able to measure quantities to
better than 3 significant figures, so giving lots and lots of digits after a
decimal place is nonsense from an epistemological point of view.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>1.7 Solving Problems in Physics</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>•What are the three stages recommended in the book for problem solving?</p>

<p id="ans">Strategy, Solution, Significance. </p>

<p>•What is the problem solving strategy?</p>

<p id="ans">Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as
stated (identify the “knowns”) Identify exactly what needs to be determined
in the problem (identify the unknowns). Determine which physical principles can
help you solve the problem. </p>

<p><span id="prob">•NOTE: Making a sketch is almost always an essential
part of problem solving</span></p>

<p>•How do you find the numerical solution to a problem?</p>

<p id="ans">Substitute the knowns (along with their units) into the appropriate
equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. </p>

<p>•What do you do to check the significance of the answer?</p>

<p id="ans">Check your units. Check the answer to see whether it is reasonable.
Check to see whether the answer tells you something interesting.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Appendix E</p>

<p>•Memorize the formulas for areas of circles, triangles and rectangles and
areas and volumes of spheres, boxes and cylinders.</p>

<p>•Know the General Quadratic Formula</p>

<p>•Remember trigonometry (SOH CAH TOA). Note the trig identities and the
expansions that can be used to find approximate solutions for limiting
cases.</p>

<p>•Note the table of derivatives and integrals.</p>

<p>•Not included in any Appendix in this book are a review of the rules for
powers and logarithms. For the following, we use the LON-CAPA conventions that
are also common to many computer programming languages): "^" means
exponentiation (e.g. x^2 is x squared), "/" means "divide by", "*" means
"multiply by", and "&lt;&gt;" means "not equal to".</p>

<p>•For exponents, you should remember that:</p>

<p>x^(-a) = 1/(x^a)</p>

<p>x^0 = 1 (for x &lt;&gt; 0)</p>

<p>x^(a+b) = (x^a)*(x^b)</p>

<p>x^(1/n) = nth root of x.</p>

<p>•For logarithms, you should remember that:</p>

<p>log(a^b) = b * log(a)</p>

<p>log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)</p>

<p>•Note that log(a + b) &lt;&gt; log(a) + log(b). If you get log(a+b), you
are stuck unless you can use an expansion to get an approximate formula.</p>
