<p><strong>Chapter 9 Linear Momentum And Collisions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A reason given why the concept of work, energy and the work-energy
    theorem are valuable are for dealing with computation with what kind of
    forces? <span id="ans">Nonconstant</span> </li>
  <li>Can physical systems evolve randomly considering energy? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">No. It can only change in a ways that conserve
        energy.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>9.1 Linear Momentum:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is momentum? Is it vector or scalar? 
    <ul>
      <li><span style="ans">Product of mass and velocity. Vector</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How is momentum different from the kinetic energy? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Momentum : vector, KE scalar, mv vs 0.5mv^2</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>9.2 Impulse and Collisions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How are momentum and force connected? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Force changes velocity and hence the momentum.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On what factors does the amount of change of the object's motion depend? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Magnitude of force and time interval over which the
        force is applied</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is impulse? Is it a vector or scalar? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>product of force and time interval. vector.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Which equation tells how impulse is related to the average force and time
    interval? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Equation 9.5</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do you need to know details of the force to calculate impulse or just the
    average force? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Often just the average force, IF you know the time interval.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Which equation tells how impulse is related to the mass and change in
    velocity? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Equation 9.6</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Example 9.1 shows a rare complicated case where the functional form
    F(t) of a non-constant force is explored. It is a good demonstration of why
    we prefer to use impulse/momentum instead of the force. It also provides a
    good visual reminder (Fig. 9.8) of how the average of a function relates to
    the actual functional form, [In this case how the average force relateds to
    F(t)]</li>
  <li><span id="comm">Fix:</span> How is the importance of seat belt and airbag
    explained in example 9.2?</li>
  <li>What does the impulse-momentum theorem state? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">The change in momentum is equal to the
      impulse.</span></li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>9.3 Conservation of Linear Momentum:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <!-- <li>Why can't the two equal but opposite forces in Newton's third law be
                              canceled? 
                              <ul>
                                <li><span id="ans">Two forces are applied to different
                                objects.</span></li>
                              </ul>
                            </li> -->
  <li>What is the law conservation of linear momentum? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Total momentum of a closed system is conservedtant or cons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is a conservation law? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">If the value of a physical quantity is constant in
        time, the quantity is conserved.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: In Figure 9.14 the caption momentum
    labels/subscripts has an inconsistency with the figure (p2 vs p3)
  </span></li>
  -What are the requirements for momemtum conservation? 
  <li><span id="ans">i) Mass of the system must remain constant during
    interaction--remember, you can choose what's in the system and what's not .
    ii) The net external force on the system must be zero.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>What is a system? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>collection of objects in whose motion is under consideration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>How is a closed system (isolated system) defined? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>system obeying above requirements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span id="comm">Fix:</span>Problem-solving strategy for conservation of
    momemtum.</li>
  <li><span id="comm">Fix</span> How is the final velocity of two carts
    sticking together after collision calculated in Example 9.6? 
    <p>-Example 9.7: Note in this example as opposed to the previous falling
    phone example, the system considered is actually the Earth + Ball. Thus the
    gravity acting on the ball, is not an external force. Ignoring gravity from
    e.g. the Sun. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>9.4 Types of Collision:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What other type of "interaction" is discussed besides a collision which
    is "One to Many"? <span id="ans">an explosions</span> 
    <p>-Many to One: NOTE: an inelastic collision is defined by Kinetic Energy
    NOT being conserved--it does not NEED to be Many to One or One to Many,
    although these cases are automatically inelastic</p>
  </li>
  <li>How does the book define a perfectly inelastic collision? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Final KE zero. colliding particles stick and remain motionless.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: Usually a <em>perfectly</em> inelastic collision is
    just defined by the objects all sticking together in the final
    configuration: they may still be moving -- the change in KE in that case is
    still maximal, as one can always move in a frame of reference moving at
    constant velocity with the final config of stuck together objects--which
    means in that frame of reference it's at rest.</span> </li>
  <li>Notice that "Many to Many" does not AUTOMATICALLY imply that a collision
    is elastic: Many-to-Many, including "2-to-2" can also be inelastic if the
    system KE does not stay constant (energy can be inserted or removed in
    invisible ways such as the collision inducing vibrations or rotations.)
    Example 9.13 is such a case--which can be seen quickly by noting the 2nd
    equation given, the ratio/relation of the i and f velocities--this can be
    easily used to calculate KE before and after using, 1/2mv^2, which will not
    be equal.

      <li>analyzed scattering of alpha particles with gold foil with the help
        of conservation of energy and momentum.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9.5 Collisions in Multiple Dimension:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How are the force and momentum related in component form? <span
    id="ans">Fx = dpx/dt, Fy = dpy/dt</span></li>
  <li>How many equations are needed to express/solve momentum conservation in 2
    Dimensions (see Eq 9.18) <span id="ans">Two</span> 
    <p>-Note the steps in the problem-solving strategy for conservation of
    momentum in two dimensions: especially that one of the first steps is to
    find the compenents of each momentum or velocity as shown in the figure
    --this is usual." : </p>

<ul>
  <li>What is internal force? <span id="comm">(Abi Nte that external force has
    been described sufficiently in previous parts)</span> 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Internal force: result of particles of the system acting on other
        particles of the same system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is the internal force for any individual part of a system always zero?
    What about the sum of all the internal forces? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">No. Yes.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do the internal forces cause to change the momentum of the system as a

    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Weighted average position of the mass of extended
        object.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Eq 9.29 is the most important equation of this section: it defines the
    center of mass. Note that it is a vector equation, as the center of mass is
    a point, ie a position: which has components in each dimension, ((2
    equations in 2D...) 
    <p>Does there have to be actual mass at the center of mass of an object? If
    not, give examples. </p>

    since this is not something usually emphasized, but the first is a good
    thing to remind them of</span> What is the first of the two listed crucial
    things to keep in mind before calculating the center of mass of any object?

  <li>What equation tells you how to calculate the center of mass of a
    continuous object? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Equation 9.34</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Which equation shows conservation of momentum expressed in terms of
    center of mass of the system? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Equation 9.36- because M times v_cm is just the same
        as the system momentum.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does the velocity of the center of mass of a system changes in the
    absence of external force? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">No, it remains constant: combining with previous
        question/answer, this implies sys momentum is constant</span></li>
