<p><strong>Chapter 9 Linear Momentum And Collisions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A reason given why the concept of work, energy and the work-energy
    theorem are valuable are for dealing with computation with what kind of
    forces? <span id="ans">Nonconstant</span> </li>
  <li>Can physical systems evolve randomly considering energy? <span
    id="ans">No. It can only change in a ways that conserve energy.</span></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>9.1 Linear Momentum:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is momentum? Is it vector or scalar? <span id="ans">Product of mass
    and velocity. Vector</span></li>
  <li>How is momentum different from the kinetic energy? <span
    id="ans">Momentum : vector, KE scalar, mv vs 0.5mv^2</span></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>9.2 Impulse and Collisions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How are momentum and force connected? <span id="ans">Force changes
    velocity and hence the momentum.</span> </li>
  <li>On what factors does the amount of change of the object's motion depend?
    <span id="ans">Magnitude of force and time interval over which the force is
    applied</span>.</li>
  <li>What is impulse? Is it a vector or scalar? <span id="ans">product of
    force and time interval. vector</span>.</li>
  <li>Which equation tells how impulse is related to the average force and time
    interval? <span id="ans">Equation 9.5</span></li>
  <li>Do you need to know details of the force to calculate impulse or just the
    average force? <span id="ans">Often just the average force, IF you know the
    time interval.</span></li>
  <li>Which equation tells how impulse is related to the mass and change in
    velocity? <span id="ans">Equation 9.6</span></li>
  <li>The Example 9.1 shows a rare complicated case where the functional form
    F(t) of a non-constant force is explored. It is a good demonstration of why
    we prefer to use impulse/momentum instead of the force. It also provides a
    good visual reminder (Fig. 9.8) of how the average of a function relates to
    the actual functional form, [In this case how the average force relateds to
    F(t)]</li>
  <li>Two different expressions of impulse (Equation 9.5 and Equation 9.6) can
    be combined to find out unknown varible from known variables. Look at how
    the average force experienced by the driver during a collision is
    calculated from the known values of time of impact and speed of car in
    Example 9.2. Why is the seat belt and airbag important?</li>
  <li>What does the impulse-momentum theorem state? <span id="ans">The change
    in momentum is equal to the impulse.</span></li>
  <li>Problem solving strategy for impulse-momentum theorem. Equate two
    expressions (Equation 9.5 and Equation 9.6) for impulse to solve desired
    quantity.</li>
  <li>Which equation is another form of Newton's second law of motion expressed
    in terms of momentum? <span id="ans">Equation 9.9</span></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>9.3 Conservation of Linear Momentum:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <!-- <li>Why can't the two equal but opposite forces in Newton's third law be
                                                                                  canceled? 
                                                                                  <ul>
                                                                                    <li><span id="ans">Two forces are applied to different
                                                                                    objects.</span></li>
                                                                                  </ul>
                                                                                </li> -->
  <li>What is the law conservation of linear momentum? <span id="ans">Total
    momentum of a closed system is conserved or constant.</span></li>
  <li>What is a conservation law? <span id="ans">If the value of a physical
    quantity is constant in time, the quantity is conserved.</span></li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: In Figure 9.14 the caption momentum
    labels/subscripts has an inconsistency with the figure (p2 vs p3)
  </span></li>
  <li>What are the requirements for momemtum conservation? <span id="ans">i)
    Mass of the system must remain constant during interaction--remember, you
    can choose what's in the system and what's not . ii) The net external force
    on the system must be zero.</span></li>
  <li>What is a system?<span id="ans">collection of objects in whose motion is
    under consideration.</span></li>
  <li>How is a closed system (isolated system) defined?<span id="ans">system
    obeying above requirements.</span></li>
  <li><span id="comm"></span>Problem-solving strategy for conservation of
    momemtum. First, identify closed sytem and equate the momentum of system
    before and after "event".</li>
  <li>How is the final velocity of two carts sticking together after collision
    calculated in Example 9.6 using the conservation of momentum? </li>
  <li>Example 9.7: Note in this example as opposed to the previous falling
    phone example, the system considered is actually the Earth + Ball. Thus the
    gravity acting on the ball, is not an external force. Ignoring gravity from
    e.g. the Sun. </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>9.4 Types of Collision:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What other type of "interaction" is discussed besides a collision which
    is "One to Many"? <span id="ans">an explosions</span> 
    <p>-Many to One: NOTE: an inelastic collision is defined by Kinetic Energy
    NOT being conserved--it does not NEED to be Many to One or One to Many,
    although these cases are automatically inelastic</p>
  </li>
  <li>How does the book define a perfectly inelastic collision?<span
    id="ans">Final KE zero. colliding particles stick and remain
    motionless.</span></li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: Usually a <em>perfectly</em> inelastic collision is
    just defined by the objects all sticking together in the final
    configuration: they may still be moving -- the change in KE in that case is
    still maximal, as one can always move in a frame of reference moving at
    constant velocity with the final config of stuck together objects--which
    means in that frame of reference it's at rest.</span> </li>
  <li>Notice that "Many to Many" does not AUTOMATICALLY imply that a collision
    is elastic: Many-to-Many, including "2-to-2" can also be inelastic if the
    system KE does not stay constant (energy can be inserted or removed in
    invisible ways such as the collision inducing vibrations or rotations.)
    Example 9.13 is such a case--which can be seen quickly by noting the 2nd
    equation given, the ratio/relation of the i and f velocities--this can be
    easily used to calculate KE before and after using, 1/2mv^2, which will not
    be equal. </li>
  <li>Problem solving strategy for collision. First, identify closed system.
    Use conservation of momentum and kinetic energy (if elastic) to solve for
    unknowns.</li>
  <li><span id="comm"></span>How are the two unknown variables (final
    velocities of two colliding hockey pucks) calculated using the two
    equations (from conservation of momentum and kinetic energy) in Example
    9.11?</li>
  <li><span id="comm"></span>How are the conservation of momentum and the
    work-energy theorem (work done by frictional force) used to analyze crash
    between a truck and a car in Example 9.13? </li>
  <li>What experiment did Rutherford perform to put forward his model about the
    structure of atom? <span id="ans">analyzed scattering of alpha particles
    with gold foil with the help of conservation of energy and
  momentum.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9.5 Collisions in Multiple Dimension:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How are the force and momentum related in component form? <span
    id="ans">Fx = dpx/dt, Fy = dpy/dt</span></li>
  <li>How many equations are needed to express/solve momentum conservation in 2
    Dimensions (see Eq 9.18) <span id="ans">Two</span> 
    <p>-Note the steps in the problem-solving strategy for conservation of
    momentum in two dimensions: especially that one of the first steps is to
    find the compenents of each momentum or velocity as shown in the figure
    --this is usual." : </p>
  </li>
  <li><span id="comm"></span>How is the conservation of momentum in two
    independent axes (X-axis and Y-axis) used to fjnd the velocity of combined
    werckage due to collision of car and truck in Example 9.14?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9.6 Center of Mass:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is internal force? <span id="ans">Internal force: result of
    particles of the system acting on other particles of the same
  system.</span></li>
  <li>Is the internal force for any individual part of a system always zero?
    What about the sum of all the internal forces? <span id="ans">No.
    Yes.</span></li>
  <li>Do the internal forces cause to change the momentum of the system as a
    whole (hint does it appear in Eq. 9.25)? <span id="ans">No</span></li>
  <li>READING EXERCISE : Why can't you lift yourself in the air by standing in
    a basket and pulling up on the handles? <span id="ans">upward pulling is
    the internal force on the basket + you system</span></li>
  <li>What is center of mass of an object? <span id="ans">Weighted average
    position of the mass of extended object.</span></li>
  <li>Eq 9.29 is the most important equation of this section: it defines the
    center of mass. Note that it is a vector equation, as the center of mass is
    a point, i.e. a position: which has components in each dimension, (2
    equations in 2D...) </li>
  <li>Does there have to be actual mass at the center of mass of an object? If
    not, give examples. <span id="ans">No. Eg; center of hollow sphere,
    doughnut. </span></li>
  <li><span id="comm"></span>How are the masses and positions (3D co-ordinante
    system) of three different objects solved independently in 3 differnt axes
    (X-, Y and Z-axis) to find the center of mass of the whole system in Figure
    9.27?</li>
  <li>Problem-solving strategy for calculating the center of mass. First, find
    out the positions of particles in a co-ordinate system (with one of the
    particle in origin). Then, solve for the each components of center of mass
    independently along the axes of co-ordinate system.</li>
  <li>What is the first of the two listed crucial things to keep in mind before
    calculating the center of mass of any object? <span id="ans">i) You must
    define your coordinate system </span></li>
  <li>What equation tells you how to calculate the center of mass of a
    continuous object? <span id="ans">Equation 9.34</span></li>
  <li>Which equation shows conservation of momentum expressed in terms of
    center of mass of the system? <span id="ans">Eqn 9.36- because M*v_cm is
    just same as the sys momentum.</span></li>
  <li>Does the velocity of the center of mass of a system changes in the
    absence of external force? <span id="ans">No, it remains constant:
    combining with previous question/answer, this implies sys momentum is
    constant</span></li>
</ul>
