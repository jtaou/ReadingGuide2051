<h1>Chapter 6 &ndash; Applications of Newton&rsquo;s Laws</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What forces are the focus of this chapter?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Friction and centripetal force</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is an example of where these forces are important?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>A race car travelling around a curve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>6.1 Solving Problems with Newton&rsquo;s Laws</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem solving strategy with applying Newton&rsquo;s laws?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Identify the physical principles involved by listing the givens and
        the quantities to be calculated. Sketch the situation, using arrows to
        represent all forces. Determine the system of interest. The result is a
        free-body diagram that is essential to solving the problem. Apply
        Newton&rsquo;s second law to solve the problem. If necessary, apply
        appropriate kinematic equations from the chapter on motion along a
        straight line. Check the solution to see whether it is reasonable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When the piano is being lifted to the second story window (See Figure
    6.2), what is the system of interest? What are the forces acting on the
    piano?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>The system of interest is the piano. Tension pulling up and weight
        pulling down.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a system accelerates horizontally, what is the magnitude of the
    acceleration in the Newton&rsquo;s second law equation for the vertical
    direction?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Zero.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the difference between static and dynamic equilibrium?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Static &ndash; objects are at rest. Dynamic &ndash; objects in motion
        without acceleration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep in mind that the pdf version of the book sometimes has odd spacing
    in the text when vectors are involved. This is obvious in the equation near
    the bottom of pdf page 270. The app, 1, and 2 are subscripts of the vector
    F, not separate variables. The html version of the book does not have these
    issues so if you think something looks weird in the pdf, check the online
    version of the book, then ask your instructor. </li>
  <li>Identify each problem solving step in Examples 6.1 &ndash; 6.5.</li>
  <li>What is the direction does normal forces point?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Perpendicular to the surface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For Example 6.3 (What does the bathroom scale read in an elevator?), if a
    person on a scale in an elevator and the elevator is accelerating downward
    does the scale read a number less than or greater than the person&rsquo;s
    weight when the elevator is at rest? What does the scale say if the
    magnitude of the elevator&rsquo;s downward acceleration is g?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Less than, Zero.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Understand Examples 6.6 and 6.7, It is sometimes necessary to combine
    concepts from different chapters to find the net force.</li>
  <li>For Example 6.8 and 6.9, keep in mind that calculus is sometimes useful
    when acceleration isn&rsquo;t constant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 Friction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is Friction?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in
        contact.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is static and kinetic friction?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to one another,
        then the friction between them is called static friction. If two
        systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the
        friction between them is called kinetic friction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When pushing a crate on a concrete floor and the crate doesn&rsquo;t
    move, are you pushing against kinetic or static friction? What friction are
    you pushing against once the crate starts to move?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Static. Kinetic.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Figure 6.10 shows a microscopic view of two surfaces. Friction arises in
    part because of the ____________ of the surfaces in contact.
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Roughness</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the equation for the magnitude of static friction? Why does it
    have a less than or equal to sign?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Equation 6.1. Because the force acts until the object starts
      moving.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the equation for the magnitude of kinetic friction?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Equation 6.2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Figure 6.11c shows the frictional force versus applied force. Why does
    the curve have a sharp peak?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Because of the less than or equal to sign in Equation 6.1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Table 6.1 contains common coefficients of friction. Given these values,
    is the coefficient of static friction always larger than the coefficient of
    kinetic friction?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Yes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 6.10 (Static and Kinetic Friction), for each push force in
    (a), (b), (c), and (d), does the box move? Why or why not?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>(a), (b), (c) &ndash; no motion, push is less than static friction
        force. (d) &ndash; it moves, the push overcomes the static friction
        force.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 6.11 (Downhill Skier), What component of the weight is equal
    to the normal force?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>W_y.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why do surfaces feel warm when they are rubbed?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>Surface atoms adhere and cause atomic lattices to vibrate, creating
        sound waves that travel through the material and generate heat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 6.12 (Sliding Blocks), Why does the bottom block have two
    separate friction forces acting on it?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
      <li>From the top block and the bottom surface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 6.13(a) and(b), does the crate slide? What is the crates
    acceleration relative to the bed of the truck?
    <ul style="color:#8000ff">
