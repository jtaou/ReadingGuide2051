<h1>Chapter 6 &ndash; Applications of Newton&rsquo;s Laws</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What forces are the focus of this chapter? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Friction and centripetal force</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is an example of where these forces are important? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>A race car travelling around a curve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>6.1 Solving Problems with Newton&rsquo;s Laws</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Which 2 of the 5 steps problem solving strategy for applying
    Newton&rsquo;s laws are covered by the strategies for drawing the FBD from
    the last Chapter? <span id="ans">2 and 3</span><!--     <li>Identify the physical principles involved by listing the givens and
                                                            the quantities to be calculated. Sketch the situation, using arrows to
                                                            represent all forces. Determine the system of interest. The result is a
                                                            free-body diagram that is essential to solving the problem. Apply
                                                            Newton&rsquo;s second law to solve the problem. If necessary, apply
                                                            appropriate kinematic equations from the chapter on motion along a
                                                            straight line. Check the solution to see whether it is reasonable.</li>--></li>
  <li>When the piano is being lifted to the second story window (See Figure
    6.2), what is the system of interest? What are the forces acting on the
    piano? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>The system of interest is the piano. Tension pulling up and weight
        pulling down.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>NOTE: if we know the system of interest in advance there is no need to
    draw other forces which act on objects outside of the system (like F_T in
    this example, which is dropped when drawing the FBD). 
    <p>-If a system accelerates purely horizontally, what is the magnitude of
    the vertical acceleration component in the Newton&rsquo;s second law
    equation for the vertical direction? </p>
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Zero.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the difference between static and dynamic equilibrium? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Static &ndash; objects are at rest. Dynamic &ndash; objects in motion
        without acceleration (ie constant v).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep in mind that the pdf version of the book sometimes has odd spacing
    in the text when vectors are involved. This is obvious in the equation near
    the bottom of pdf page 270. The app, 1, and 2 are subscripts of the vector
    F, not separate variables. The html version of the book does not have these
    issues so if you think something looks weird in the pdf, check the online
    version of the book, then ask your instructor. </li>
  <li>Identify each problem solving step in Examples 6.1 &ndash; 6.5.</li>
  <li>What is the direction do normal forces point? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Perpendicular to their surface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For Example 6.3 (What does the bathroom scale read in an elevator?), if a
    person on a scale in an elevator and the elevator is accelerating downward
    does the scale read a number less than or greater than the person&rsquo;s
    weight when the elevator is at rest? What does the scale say if the
    magnitude of the elevator&rsquo;s downward acceleration is g? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Less than, Zero.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>-In Example 6.4/6.5 the effect of the pulley causes two important effects
    that are used in a wide variety of problems in this course: 1) The
    rope/string to change direction as it bends around the pulley and 2)
    because it is "massless, frictionless", is the tension in the rope on
    either side of the rope, the same or different? <span id="ans">The
    same</span> 
    <p>-Examples 6.4/6.5 also contain another very common occurrence in force
    problems where one needs to solve for two unknowns with two equations, ie
    solving two equations simultaneously. It is good to review the algebra
    techniques for this again if they are still not fresh in your mind.</p>
    <p>-Do the two equations in Examples 6.4/6.5 come from the fact that there
    are two-dimensions or because there are two objects? <span id="ans">two
    objects</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>-Understand Examples 6.6/6.7, It is sometimes necessary to combine
    concepts from different chapters to find the net force. Which kinematic
    variable from Chapter 3 and 4 needs calculated from the given velocities in
    these examples before (or in addition to) performing the Force Problem
    Solving Strategy 
    <p><span id="prob">-NOTE: TYPO in p. 278 (7/31/17 pdf) inExample 6.6 At the
    beginning of the Strategy section: "We know that &Delta;t = 2.00s and
    (6.00i ^ + 12.00j ^ m/s) &minus; (5.00j ^ m/s)" should be " We know that
    &Delta;t = 2.00s and <strong>&Delta;v =</strong> (6.00i^+
    12.00...".</span></p>
    <p>-For Example 6.8 and 6.9, keep in mind that calculus is sometimes useful
    when acceleration isn&rsquo;t constant. <span id="prob">NOTE: We typically
    do not cover non-constant forces in Physics 2051 until we introduce energy
    (which is a more systematic way of dealing with non-constant forces,
    amongst other things). </span></p>

<h3>6.2 Friction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is Friction? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in
        contact.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is static and kinetic friction? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>static: two contacting surfaces are stationary relative to one
        another (attempted movement). Kinetic: Surfaces are moving relative to
        one another.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When pushing a crate on a concrete floor and the crate doesn&rsquo;t
    move, are you pushing against kinetic or static friction? What friction are
    you pushing against once the crate starts to move? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Static. Kinetic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Figure 6.10 shows a microscopic view of two surfaces. Friction arises in
    part because of the ____________ of the surfaces in contact. 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Roughness or any word meaning similar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Which equation gives an expression constraining the magnitude of static
    friction? Why does it have a less than or equal to sign? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Equation 6.1. Because the expression only gives the maximum magnitude
        possible (&mu;<sub>s</sub>*NormForce). It is "usually" less.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p>NOTE: "Usually" the magnitude of static friction is simply the minimum
    needed to counteract any other forces acting in the problem, calculated by
    Newton's 2nd Law considering all other forces in the problem: a "reaction"
    force. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Which equation is for the magnitude of kinetic friction? </p>
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Equation 6.2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Figure 6.11c shows the frictional force versus applied force. Why does
    the curve rise linearly in the labeled "Static Region" ? <span id="ans">See
    previous NOTE above. Because the static force is a reaction force: it
    simply cancels any applied force so that Sum F = 0.</span> 
    <p>-Figure 6.11c: At small applied forces and above, is it mostly larger or
    smaller than its value in the labeled "Kinetic Region" ? <span
    id="ans">mostly smaller until it gets near the maximum. </span></p>
    <p>-Figure 6.11c: . Why does the curve have a sharp peak? </p>
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>One answer: this is related to the less than or equal to sign in
        Equation 6.1. See above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Table 6.1 contains common coefficients of friction. Given these values,
    is the coefficient of static friction always larger than the coefficient of
    kinetic friction? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Yes. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 6.10 (Static and Kinetic Friction), for each push force in
    (a), (b), (c), and (d), does the box move? Why or why not? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>(a), (b), (c) &ndash; no motion, push is less than static friction
        force. (d) &ndash; it moves, the push overcomes the static friction
        force.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 6.10 is (a), (b), (c) is the magnitude of static friction
    given by fs = &mu;<sub>s</sub><sub></sub>F<sub>N</sub> ? <span id="ans">No,
    because the maximum possible is not needed, so this formula is not used,
    instead it equals what cancels/balances the applied force</span> 
    <p>In Example 6.11 (Downhill Skier), What component of the weight is equal
    to the normal force? </p>
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>W_y.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The trig relation sin x/cos x = tan x used after Example 6.11 is used
    several times in this course. 
    <p>Why do surfaces feel warm when they are rubbed? </p>
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Surface atoms adhere/ cause atomic lattices to vibrate, creating
        sound waves generating heat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 6.12 (Sliding Blocks), Why does the bottom block have two
    separate friction forces acting on it? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>From the top block and the bottom surface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Example 6.13(a) and(b), does the crate slide? READING EXERCISE: What
    is the crates acceleration relative to the bed of the truck? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>(a) &ndash; No. (b) &ndash; yes. -2.06 m/s^2 ( =5-2.94)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>6.3 Centripetal Force </h3>
<ul>
  <li><span id="comm">Tyler a lot of this stuff I added in this sectionis very
    specific to how we teach the course in 2051 typically, probably not much in
    here should you bother trying to "emulate"</span> 
    <p>-Notice the word "net" in the book's definition of centripetal force:
    What is centripetal force according to the book: "Any net force providing
    ____________ ____________ motion?" What direction does it point? </p>
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>uniform circular. Toward the center of the circle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>-NOTE: "Any net force..." means that centripetal force is just a
    categorization for any group of forces, (summed in the net force sum), or
    even just certain <em>components</em> of forces. Those which contribute to
    the acceleration IN THE RADIAL direction during circular motion. Notice in
    Example 6.16 (the 2nd example) it is only the horizontal component of the
    normal force, not the whole normal force which is considered the
    centripetal force. 
    <p>-NOTE: centripetal force (or acceleration) does not <em>only</em> apply
    to only UNIFORM circular motion, but can also apply to accelerating
    circular motion. </p>
    <p>-In Example 6.15, which force or forces contribute to the centripetal
    force? <span id="ans">(static friction only)</span></p>
    <p>-Which equation gives centripetal force in terms of mass, velocity,
    angular velocity, and radius of curvature? </p>
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Equation 6.3.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <!-- <li>When a road is banked at a _________ angle, the _________ you can take
        the curve. 
        <ul id="ans">

        </ul>
      </li> -->
  <li>What must be true for ideal banking? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>External force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence
        of friction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Which equation gives the ideal banking angle? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Equation 6.4.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>-NOTE: Notice in Example 6.16 (the 2nd example) it is only the horizontal
    component of the normal force (Nx), not the whole normal force which is
    considered the centripetal force. If friction is present in that case it
    would be the sum of Nx AND the horizontal component of the friction force
    which would be categorized as the centripetal force. 
    <p>-When you turn right in a car, you move in a __________ line, but the
    car moves ___________, you are not experiencing a force from the _________.

    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Force that always opposes the motion of an object in a fluid; unlike
        simple friction, the drag force is proportional to some function of the
        velocity of the object in that fluid. Equation 6.5.</li>
