</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>3.2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed:</strong></p>

<p></p>

  <li>What does instantaneous velocity tell us and how is it defined? <span
    id="ans">How fast an object is moving at any instant. Equation
  3.4</span></li>
  <li>NOTE: the reason we take &#x394;t --&gt; 0 is because we want the

  T^-1]</span></li>
  <li>How can it be found from the graph of position vs. time graph? slope of

    calculated over an instant</span></li>
  <li>Note how is it calculated in Example 3.6 from the velocity as funtion of
    time by calculating the derivative, etc.</li>
  <!--<li>How can one find the instantaneous acceleration from the velocity vs.
                                                                          time graph? (Figure 3.14 and Figure 3.15)</li>-->
  <li>What do the zeros of the instantaneous acceleration in velocity vs. time
    graph <span id="prob">USUALLY but not always</span> signify? (e.g. see
    Figure 3.16) <span id="ans">a maximum or minimum in the instantaneous
    velocity </span></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>3.4 Motion with constant acceleration:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note how to derive equation 3.10 to 3.14 and review them in the Summary
    Table </li>
  <li>NOTE: The discussion about extreme values just after the summary tables
    is not important.</li>
  <li><span id="comm"></span>In solving for variable related to motion of an
    object, first, list down all known variables and look for the correct
    kinematic equations to find the desired variable from the known variables.
    Note how this strategy is implemented in examples (3.7 to 3.12).</li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: A more detailed methodology/strategy for problem
    solving is given in the later Free Fall section which can also be followed
    for these kinds or any kind of 1-D motion problem</span> 
    <p><span style="background-color:#ffff00">-What insight does the equation
    3.14 give to you?</span> <span id="ans"
    style="background-color:#ffff00">Dependence of final velocity with
    acceleration. How the stopping distance related to the speed at constant
    acceleration.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li><span>What is two-body pursuit problem?</span> <span id="ans">Motion of
    two objects: two sets of equations of motion: one for each body</span></li>
  <li>While solving two body pursuit problem, we set up equations of motion for
    both bodies and look for the common parameter (eg. time, distance) and set
    them equal for two bodies. Look how this strategy is implemented for the
    Cheeth Catching a Gazelle problem in Example 3.13. </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>3.5 Free Fall:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is free fall? <span id="ans">Motion of object solely in
    gravitational field.</span></li>
  <li>How does the acceleration of gravity/free fall change with the mass of
    objects if the air resistance is negligible?<span id="ans">it doesn't: it
    is constant with mass, same for all objects (g)</span></li>
  <li><span>How does air resistance affect the motion of object in free
    fall?</span> <span id="ans">opposes it and slows it down</span></li>
  <li>For freefall problems, what determines whether we set the acceleration a
    = +g or -g? <span id="ans">Determined by which direction we choose to be
    positive displacement/position, whether up or down. Usually we choose up as
    +y, so a = -g, negative, as in Eq.s 3.15-17</span></li>
  <li>What is the average value of <em>g</em> on earth? <span id="ans">9.81
    m/s^2</span></li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: all FOUR of the equations of kinematics in the
    previous summary table can be used in an analogous way as the three shown
    here: ie this table (Eq 3.15-17) should also include &#x394;y = (Vy0+Vyf) t
    /2 </span> 
    <p>-Note what changes in the equations of kinematics for objects in free
    fall? (Equations 3.15 to 3.17) </p>
  </li>
  <li>Learn the Problem-Solving strategy for Free Fall</li>
  <li>For the motion under free fall, the velocity at miximum height is always
    zero and time taken to rise is always equal to time taken to fall. Note how
    these properties are used to solve the problem about vertical motion of a
    baseball in Example 3.15. </li>
</ul>

<strong>3.6 Finding Velocity and Displacement from Acceleration</strong> 

<p>-Eq. 3.18 was obtained by taking the indefinite integral of BOTH sides the
starting equation of this section: why does the integral sign no longer appear
on the Left Hand Side of Eq. 3.18-where did it go?<span id="ans">Integration is
the inverse operation to the derivative so it "cancels" out or undoes the d/dt,
leaving only v</span></p>

<p>- The velocity can be obtained from integratin from integration of
acclereation while the position is obtained from integration of velocity. The
constants of integrations are found using initial conditions. Look how the
problem of Motion of Motorboat in Example 3.17.</p>

<p><span id="prob">-NOTE: Example 3.17: Unit of acceleration a(t) = 1/4 t m/s^2
should be m/s^3. This error propagates throughout the example. </span></p>
