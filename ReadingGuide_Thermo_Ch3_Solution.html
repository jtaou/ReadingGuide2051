<p><strong>Chapter 3: The First Law of Thermodynamics:</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p><br />

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<br />

<p><ins>-Is energy conserved in thermonynamic process? <span
id="ans">Yes.</span></ins></p>

<p></p>
<br />

<p><strong>3.1 Thermodynamic Systems:</strong></p>
<br />

<p><ins>-What is thermodynamic system? <span id="ans">Anything whose
thermodynamic properties are of interest.</span></ins></p>

<p>-What is boundary? <span id="ans">Imaginary wall that separates the system
with the environment.</span></p>

<p>-What is closed system? <span id="ans">sytem completely seperated from its
environment.</span></p>

<p>-What is open system? <span id="ans">system which can exchange energy
and/or matter with surroundings.</span></p>

<p>-What dictates the thermodynamic equilibrium of a system? <span
id="ans">heat transfer between system and its envrionment or between the
different parts of the system.</span></p>

<p>-What is equation of state? <span id="ans">Relationship between basic
properties of the system.</span></p>

<p>-What is extensive variables? Give examples.<span id="ans">Extensive:
quantity associated with an amount of matter. eg. volume, number of
moles.</span></p>

<p>-What is intensive variables? Give examples. <span id="ans">Intensive:
quantity not associated with amount of matter. eg. pressure,
temperature.</span></p>

<p></p>
<br />

<p><strong>3.2 Work, Heat, and Internal Energy:</strong></p>
<br />

<p>-What is the general expression of the net work for the finite change in
volume? <span id="ans">Eqn. (3.4)</span></p>

<p>-What is quasi-static process? <span id="ans">Process that takes place in
infinitley small steps, keeping the system at thermal equilibrium.</span></p>

<p><span id="prob">-Note: NO equation number is given for the work done by an
ideal gas in isothermal process.</span></p>

<p>-Is thermodynamic work path dependent or path independent? <span
id="ans">Path dependent.</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for the internal energy of an ideal monoatomic gas?
<span id="ans">Eqn. (3.6) </span></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<br />

<p><strong>3.3 First Law of Thermodynamics:</strong></p>
<br />

<p>-What is first law of thermodynamics? <span id="ans">The change in
internal energy for any transition between two equilibrium state = heat
exchanged - work</span></p>

<p>-When is work done -ve (+ve)?<span id="ans">When work is done on the
system (by the system).</span></p>

<p>-Table 3.1: Look at the sign conventions for heat and work.</p>

<p>-What is state function? Give examples. <span id="ans">whose values depend
only on the state of the system. eg. internal energy.</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for the first law of thermodynamics in differential
form? <span id="ans">Eqn. (3.8)</span></p>

<p>-Example 3.4: Look how the first law of thermodynamics along with path
independence of internal energy is used to calculate the heat transition along
ADC.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<br />

<p><strong>3.4 Thermodynamic Processes:</strong></p>
<br />
</p>
<ins><ins><p>-What are the thermodynamical variables for an ideal gas? <span
id="ans">pressure, volume, temperature and number of molecules.</span></p>
</ins></ins>
<p><p>-What is isothermal process? <span id="ans">change in state of the
system at a constant temperature.</span></p>

<p>-What is isobaric and isochoric processes? <span id="ans">Isobaric:
pressure constant. Isochoric: Volume constant.</span></p>

<p>-What is adiabatic process?<span id="ans">Absence of heat
exchange.</span></p>

<p>-Why does the adiabatic expansion leads to drop in temperature? <span
id="ans">System does work and energy goes down and hence the decrease in
temperature.</span></p>

<p>-Why does the adiabatic compression leads to increase in temperature? <span
id="ans">Work is done on the system and energy increases.</span></p>

<p>-What is cyclic process?<span id="ans">if the state of the system at the
end is same as at the begining.</span></p>

<p>-What remain unchanged during the cyclic process? <span
id="ans">Temperature, volume and internal energy.</span></p>

<p><ins>-What will be the relation between the heat exchanged and work done in
cyclic process? <span id="ans">Equal.</span></ins></p>

<p></p>
<br />

<p><strong>3.5 Heat Capacities of an Ideal Gas:</strong></p>
<br />

<p>-What is the relation between the molar heat capacity at constant volume and
that at constant pressure? <span id="ans">Eqn. (3.10)</span></p>

<p>-Table 3.3: Look at the molar heat capacities at constant volume and that at
constant pressure for monoatomic, diatomic and polyatomic ideal gas.</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<br />

<p><strong>3.6 Adiabatic Processes for an Ideal Gas:</strong></p>
<br />

<p>-What are the equations that and ideal gas in an quasi-static adiabatic
process follow? <span id="ans">Eqn.(3.12) to (3.14)</span></p>

<p>-Compare the isothermal and adiabatic curves. <span id="ans">Adiabatic
curve is more steeper than isothermal curve.</span></p>
