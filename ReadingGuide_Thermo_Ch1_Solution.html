<p></p>
<br></br>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<br></br>
<p>-What is thermonynamics?<span id="ans">study of heat and
temperature</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<br></br>
<p><strong>1.1 Temperature and Thermal Equilibrium:</strong></p>
<br></br>
<p><ins>-What is heat transfer?<span id="ans">movement of energy from one to
another as a result of temperature difference.</span></ins></p>

<p>-When are the two objects in thermal equilibrium? <span id="ans">If there is
no net enrgy transferred between them even if they allow either to gain energy
from other.</span></p>

<p>-What is Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics? <span id="ans">If "A" is thermal
equilibrium with "B" and "B" is thermal equilibrium with "C" then "A" and "B"
are also thermal equlibrium with each other.</span></p>

<p></p>

<br></br>
<p><strong>1.3 Thermal Expansion:</strong></p>
<br></br>
<p>-What is thermal expansion?<span id="ans">change in size or volume as a
result of temperature change.</span></p>

<p><ins>-How does the increase in kinetic energy expand substance? <span
id="ans">Linnard-Jones potential describing molecular force is asymmetric. So,
the distance moved by molecules away from eachother in a given kinetic energy
is greater than the distance they move towards eachother.</span></ins></p>

<p>-Is there any preferred direction of expansion? <span id="ans">No. It is
isotropic.</span></p>

temperature? <span id="ans">Eqn. (1.2)</span></p>

<span id="ans">Eqn. (1.3)</span></p>

<p>-Figure 1.7: Look how the area of circular plug inside the cube increases as
the temperature increases.</p>

<p>-What is the expression for the change in volume due to change in
temperature? Eqn.(1.4)</p>

<p>-what is the temperature where density of water highest at?<span id="ans">4
degree celcius.</span></p>

<p>-How can aquatic life can survive in frozen lake? <span id="ans">The water
beneath ice is at 4 degree celcius.</span></p>

<p>-Firure 1.8: Look how does the density of water changes with temperature.</p>

<p>-What is thermal stress? <span id="ans">Stress due to change in
temperature.</span></p>

<p>-Why the gaps are left between blocks in highway? <span id="ans">To prevent
from developing thermal stress.</span></p>

<p></p>
<br></br>
<p><strong>1.4 Heat Transfer, Specific Heat, and Calorimetry:</strong></p>
<br></br>

<p>-What is mechanical equvalent of heat? What is its value? <span id="ans">The
work needed to produce the same effects as heat transfer. 1.0 Kcal = 4186
J</span></p>

<p>-What is state variable? <span id="ans">well defined quantity that depends
only on the current state of the system rather than the history of that
system.</span></p>

<p>-Give example of state variables. Are heat and work state variables? <span
id="ans">Temperature, Internal Energy. No, they are not.</span></p>

lost by hotter object is equal to heat gained by colder object.</span></p>

to calculate the final temperature of water and pan at equilibrium.</p>
