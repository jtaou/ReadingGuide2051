<h1>Chapter 8 &ndash; Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>- What principle governs a ball&rsquo;s change in kinetic energy and relates
them to transfers for other types of energy? <span id="ans">Conservation of
energy.</span></p>

<h3>8.1 &ndash; Potential Energy of a System</h3>

<p>- What is potential energy?<span id="ans">Function of position, energy
possessed by an object relative to the system considered</span></p>

<p>- In Figure 8.2, where is kinetic energy maximum? Minimum? Where is
potential energy maximum? Minimum? <span id="ans">KE: max at points 1 and 5,
min at point3. PE: max at 3, min at 1 and 5.</span></p>

<p>- The idea that *difference* in potential energy is the same, no matter what
the point of reference is chosen to be is extremely important both practically
and philosophically. The actual value of energy at any given position is
entirely arbitrary (the formal way of saying it is that energy is only
determined to within an arbitrary additive constant). The difference in
potential energy, however, is independent of that choice of origin. This means
that you can pick the reference point for your convenience to make the problem
simpler.</p>

<p>- How should one choose the point of zero potential energy in a problem?
<span id="ans">Choose a point that is most convenient.</span></p>

<p>- In Example 8.1 (Basic Properties of Potential Energy) How are the
solutions to (a) and (b) related? <span id="ans">Difference of (b) solutions is
the (a) solution.</span></p>

<p>- What is the equation for gravitational potential energy? <span
id="ans">Equation 8.5.</span></p>

<p>- In Example 8.2 (Gravitational Potential Energy of a Hiker), at which
points is the gravitational potential energy the highest? Lowest? <span
id="ans">Highest at summit. Lowest at sea level.</span></p>

<p>- What is the equation for elastic potential energy? <span id="ans">Equation
8.7.</span></p>

<p>- Is the elastic potential energy the same for positive and negative
lengths? <span id="ans">Yes</span></p>

<p>- Understand why Table 8.1 says what kind of energy occurs at each point in
the situation shown in Figure 8.5.</p>

<p>- Ignore Example 8.4 (Potential Energy of a Mass-Spring System) because it
has a number of errors.</p>

<h3>8.2 &ndash; Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces</h3>

<p>- What is a conservative force? What is a non-conservative force? <span
id="ans">Conservative - force that does work independent of path.
Non-conservative &ndash; force that does work that depends on path.</span></p>

<p>- What are examples of conservative and non-conservative forces? <span
id="ans">Gravity, springs and friction, air resistance.</span></p>

<p>- The E in equation 8.9 should be an F. Work is the integral of force over
the displacement.</p>

<p>- What is a closed path? <span id="ans">The sum of two paths, a to b then b
back to a.</span></p>

<p>- What does path independence mean for the work done by a conservative
force? <span id="ans">The path to go from a to b doesn&rsquo;t
matter.</span></p>

<h3>8.3 &ndash; Conservation of Energy</h3>

<p>- What is a conserved quantity? <span id="ans">Quantity that cannot be
created or destroyed, but may be transformed between different forms of
itself.</span></p>

<p>- What is mechanical energy? <span id="ans">Sum of potential and kinetic
energy.</span></p>

<p>- What does the conservation of energy mean? <span id="ans">The mechanical
energy E of a particle stays constant unless forces outside the system or
non-conservative forces do work on it, in which case, the change in the
mechanical energy is equal to the work done by the non-conservative forces.
Equation 8.12.</span></p>

<p>- What is the problem solving strategy for solving problems involving the
conservation of energy? <span id="ans">Identify the body or bodies to be
studied (the system). Identify all forces acting on the body or bodies.
Determine whether each force that does work is conservative. For every force
that does work, choose a reference point and determine the potential energy
function for the force. Apply the principle of mechanical energy conservation
by setting the sum of the kinetic energies and potential energies equal at
every point of interest.</span></p>

<p>- The equation at the top of pdf page 374 is a convenient way to write the
conservation of mechanical energy when solving these types of problems.</p>

<p>- Figure 8.9 shows the mechanical energy at three points of the pendulum
swing from Example 8.7 (Simple Pendulum). Is mechanical energy conserved? <span
id="ans">Yes.</span></p>

<h3>8.4 &ndash; Potential Energy Diagrams and Stability</h3>

<p>- What is a potential energy diagram? <span id="ans">Graph of a
particle&rsquo;s potential energy as a function of position.</span></p>

<p>- Understand Figure 8.11 to understand the energy distribution of an object
in freefall.</p>

<p>- Understand Figure 8.12 to understand the energy distribution of an object
attached to two springs.</p>

<p>- What is a turning point? <span id="ans">Position where the velocity of a
particle, in one-dimensional motion, changes sign.</span></p>

<p>- What is an equilibrium point? <span id="ans">Position where the assumed
conservative, net force on a particle, given by the slope of its potential
energy curve, is zero.</span></p>

<p>- Example 8.10 shows how to find equilibrium points for an arbitrary
potential.</p>

<h3><span style="background-color:#ffff00">8.5 &ndash; Sources of
Energy</span></h3>

<p style="background-color:#ffff00">- What are other forms of energy listed in
the text? <span id="ans">Thermal energy, electrical energy, chemical energy,
radiant energy, nuclear energy.</span></p>

<p style="background-color:#ffff00"><span style="background-color:#ffff00">-
Since energy is always conserved, why should we be concerned about our energy
resources? </span>- What is the difference between renewable and non-renewable
energy sources? <span id="ans">Renewable - energy source that is replenished
by natural processes, over human time scales. Non-renewable - energy source
that is not renewable, but is depleted by human consumption.</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffff00"><span id="ans">Most energy
transformations produce waste heat.</span></span></p>
