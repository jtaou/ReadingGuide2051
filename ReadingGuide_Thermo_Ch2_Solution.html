<p><strong>Chapter 2: The Kinetic Theory of Gases</strong></p>
<br />

<p></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<br />

<p>-What is kinetic theory of gases? <span id="ans">molecular model of
gases</span></p>
<br />

<p></p>

<p><strong>2.1 Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas:</strong></p>
<br />

<p>-which has largest coefficient of volume expansion among solid, liquid and
gas?<span id="ans">Gas</span>.</p>

<p>-What is Boyle's law? <span id="ans">At constant temperatuer and no. of
molecules, the absolute pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its
volume.</span></p>

<p>-What is absolute pressure? <span id="ans">True pressure.</span></p>

<p>-What is gauge pressure? <span id="ans">Absolute pressure - Ambient
pressure.</span></p>

<p>-What is Charle's law? <span id="ans">At constant pressure and number of
molecules, the volume of a gas is proportional to its absolute
temperature.</span></p>

<p>-What is an ideal gas? <span id="ans">Gas at low density and high
temperature.</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for ideal gas law? <span id="ans">Eqn.
(2.1)</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for ideal gas law when the number of molecules in
gas is constant? <span id="ans">Eqn. (2.2)</span></p>

<p>-What should be the unit of temperature in ideal gas law?<span
id="ans">kelvin.</span></p>

<p>-What pressure must be used in ideal gas law? <span id="ans">Absoulte
pressure (gaue + atmospheric pressure).</span></p>

<p>-Example 2.1: Look how the ideal gas law is used to find out the change in
pressure with temperature.</p>

<p>-Example 2.2: What is STP(standard temperature and pressure)? <span
id="ans">Temperature: 273 K. Pressure: 1 atm.</span></p>

<p>-What is a mole? A<span id="ans">mount of substance that contains as many
molecules as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams of Carbon-12.</span></p>

<p>-What is Avogardo's number? <span id="ans">The number of molecules in one
mole.</span></p>

<p>-What is unified atomic mass unit (u) or dalton? <span id="ans">unit of mass
such that the mass of an atom is aproximately equal to sum of its no. of
protons and neutrons.</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for ideal gas law in terms of moles? <span
id="ans">Eqn. (2.3)</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for Van der Waals Equation of State? <span
id="ans">Eqn. (2.4)</span></p>

<p>-What are the two factors taken into account for the derivation of Van der
Waals Equation of State? <span id="ans">First:attractive force between the
molecules. Second:Volume of molecules</span></p>

<p>-What is isotherm? <span id="ans">Curve showing pressure as function of
volume with no. of molecules and temperature fixed.</span></p>
<br />

<p></p>

<p><strong>2.2 Pressure, Temperature, and RMS Speed</strong></p>
<br />

<p>-What is the expression for average kinetic energy per molecule? <span
id="ans">Eqn. (2.6)</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for the internal energy for a monoatomic ideal gas?
<span id="ans">Eqn.(2.7)</span></p>

<p>-What is partial pressure? <span id="ans">The pressure a gas would create if
it occupied the total volume.</span></p>

<p>-What is Dalton's law of partial pressure? <span id="ans">Total pressure is
the sum of partial pressure of the component gases.</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for relative humidity?<span id="ans">ratio of
partial pressure of water vapor to vapor pressure of water at the same
temperature.</span></p>

<p><span id="prob">-Note: Equation no. is not given for the expression of
relative humidity.</span></p>

<p>-What is mean free path?<span id="ans">average distance travelled by a
molecule between collision with antother molecule.</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for mean free path? <span id="ans">Eqn. (2.10) &amp;
Eqn. (2.11)</span></p>

<p>-What is the expression for mean free time?<span id="ans">Eqn.
(2.12)</span></p>

<p></p>
<br />

<p><strong>2.3 Heat Capacity and Equipartition of Energy:</strong></p>
<br />

<p>-Why the specific heat capacity defined in terms of number of moles? <span
id="ans">the properties of ideal gas depend directly on the number of
moles.</span></p>

<p>-What is the expressin for heat exhanged due to temperature difference in
terms of molar heat capacity at constant volume and no. of moles? <span
id="ans">Equation 2.13</span></p>

<p>-What are the additional energies beside translational kinetic energy for
the polyatomic molecules? <span id="ans">Rotational and vibrational kinetic
energy.</span></p>

<p>-What is degree of freedom?<span id="ans">independent possible motions of a
molecule.</span></p>

<p>-What is equipartition theorem? <span id="ans">Energy of a thermodynamic
system in equilibrium is partitioned equally among its degrees of freedom.
Equation 2.14</span></p>
<br />

<p></p>

<p><strong>2.4 Distribution of Molecular Speeds:</strong></p>
<br />

speed. Equation 2.17</span></p>
