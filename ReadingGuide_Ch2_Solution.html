<h1><strong>Chapter 2 &#x2013; Vectors</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
- What does one need to know, in addition to distance, to get to a town from
the sign post in Figure 2.1? <span id="ans">The direction the town is
in.</span> 

<p><strong>2.1 Scalers and Vectors </strong></p>

<p>- What is a scalar quantity? <span id="ans">Quantity that is fully specified
by a single number with a unit. </span></p>

<p>- What are some examples of scalar quantities?<span id="ans">Temperature.
Calories.</span></p>

<p>- What is a vector quantity? <span id="ans">Quantity that is fully specified
by a number (with units) and direction.</span> </p>

<p>- How are vectors represented geometrically/visually (see Figure 2.2)? <span
id="ans">Geometrically, vectors are represented by arrows.</span></p>

<p>- How are vectors and scalars represented in this book?<span
id="ans">Vectors: boldface letter with an arrow above it. Scalars: letter
without an arrow. </span></p>

<p>- In Figure 2.3, what is the arrow that starts at point A and ends at point
B called? What is its length called? <span id="ans">A displacement vector. The
magnitude.</span></p>

<p>- NOTE: The equals sign with three lines (&#x2261;) means "equivalent to"
Does the displacement vector tell us what the actual path of the particle is?
<span id="ans">No. Just the distance and direction from the start and end
points.</span></p>

<p>- What does it mean for two vectors to be antiparallel? Parallel?
Orthogonal? See the summary in Figure 2.5. <span id="ans">Antiparallel vectors
point 180 degrees from each other. Parallel vectors point in the same
direction. Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular to one another.</span></p>

<p><span id="prob">NOTE: Keep in mind that the pdf version of the book
sometimes has odd spacing in the text when vectors are involved. This is
obvious in the equation on the middle of pdf page 48. The AC and AB are
subscripts of the vector D, not separate variables. The html version of the
book does not have these issues so if you think something looks weird in the
pdf, check the online version of the book, then ask your instructor. </span>
</p>

<p>- What is a vector equation? <span id="ans">Equation with vectors on the
left and right hand sides: implies direction AND magnitude of both sides is the
same</span> </p>

<p>- What is a scalar equation? <span id="ans">Equation with scalars on the
left and right hand sides.</span></p>

<p>- Understand Figure 2.7. It shows how one-dimensional vector quantities are
added or subtracted.</p>

<p>- If a scalar is multiplied times a vector, is the result another vector or
another scalar? <span id="ans">another vector</span></p>

<p>- What is a resultant&#x201d;? <span id="ans">The sum of 2 or more
vectors.</span></p>

<p>- What does it mean to say that vector addition is commutative and
associative? <span id="ans">Commutative &#x2013; A+B=B+A. associative (A+B)+C =
A+(B+C). </span> </p>

<p>- What does commutativity mean for the order in which you add vectors? <span
id="ans">The order doesn&#x2019;t matter.</span></p>

<p><span id="prob">NOTE: Unit vectors are an important concept we will focus on
heavily in the course</span> </p>

<p>- What is a unit vector? How are they represented? <span id="ans">Special
vector that has magnitude = 1 and no units: specifies only a direction. A
boldface letter with a ^ above it (instead of an arrow)</span> </p>

<p>- Go over Example 2.1 - A Ladybug Problem. What is the final position of the
ladybug on the meter stick? <span id="ans">68 cm.</span> </p>

<p>- Where is the geometric (also called graphical) approach to adding vectors
commonly used? <span id="ans">Navigation.</span></p>

<p>- What are the two methods of adding vectors in two dimensions
geometrically/graphically discussed in the book? <span id="ans">The
parallelogram rule and head-to-tail construction.</span></p>

<p>- Understand Figure 2.10 to understand the parallelogram rule.</p>

<p><span id="prob1">NOTE: The word "translate" used here is a technical term
that has a special meaning for vectors which is "to move the vector graphically
(on the page) such that its length and direction are preserved"</span></p>

<p>- The tail-to-head geometric construction involves arranging 2 vectors
graphically in what way? <span id="ans">translate one of the vectors such that
its tail touches the head of the other.</span></p>

<p>- Go over Example 2.2 &#x2013; Geometric Construction of the Resultant. Are
A + B and A - B pointing in the same direction? <span id="ans">No.</span></p>
<strong>2.2 Coordinate Systems and Components of a Vector </strong> 

<p><span id="prob">NOTE: First paragraph: "orthogonal projections" :
projection: another vector which represents the length of the vector in a
certain direction. orthogonal: choose two directions for the projections which
are perpendicular </span></p>

<p>- What is the x component and the y component of a vector? <span
id="ans">Projections of a vector onto the x and y axes.</span></p>

<p>- What are "unit vectors of the axes"? How are they represented
symbolically? What axes/direction does

</math> point? i? What is the component form of a vector? <span
id="ans">Vectors of length one that define orthogonal directions on the plane.
Along x &#x2013; i^, along y &#x2013; j^. Along x &#x2013; i^, along y &#x2013;
j^. The magnitude of the x component of a vector is multiplied by i^ and the
magnitude of the y component of a vector is multiplied by j^ (...). Then vector
written as sum of component terms. </span></p>

reviewed.</p>

CAH TOA")</p>
