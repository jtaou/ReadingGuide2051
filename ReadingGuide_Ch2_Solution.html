<h1><strong>Chapter 2 &#x2013; Vectors</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
-What does one need to know, in addition to distance, to get to a town from the
sign post in Figure 2.1? <span id="ans">The direction the town is in.</span> 

<p><strong>2.1 Scalers and Vectors </strong></p>

<p>-What is a scalar quantity? <span id="ans">Quantity that is fully specified
by a single number with a unit. </span></p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some examples of scalar quantities?<span id="ans"></span> 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Temperature. Calories.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is a vector quantity?<span id="ans"></span> 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Quantity that is fully specified by a number (with
        units) and direction.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How are vectors represented geometrically/visually (see Figure 2.2)? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Geometrically, vectors are represented by
        arrows.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How are vectors and scalars represented in this book? 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Vectors: boldface letter with an arrow above it. Scalars: letter
        without an arrow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Figure 2.3, what is the arrow that starts at point A and ends at point
    B called? What is its length called? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">A displacement vector. The magnitude.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>NOTE: The equals sign with three lines (&#x2261;) means "equivalent
  to"</li>
  <li>Does the displacement vector tell us what the actual path of the particle
    is? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">No. Just the distance and direction from the start and
        end points.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What does it mean for two vectors to be antiparallel? Parallel?
    Orthogonal? See the summary in Figure 2.5. 
    <ul id="ans">
      <li>Antiparallel vectors point 180 degrees from each other. Parallel
        vectors point in the same direction. Orthogonal vectors are
        perpendicular to one another.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: Keep in mind that the pdf version of the book
    sometimes has odd spacing in the text when vectors are involved. This is
    obvious in the equation on the middle of pdf page 48. The AC and AB are
    subscripts of the vector D, not separate variables. The html version of the
    book does not have these issues so if you think something looks weird in
    the pdf, check the online version of the book, then ask your instructor.
    </span></li>
  <li>What is a vector equation? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Equation with vectors on the left and right hand
        sides: implies direction AND magnitude of both sides is the
      same</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is a scalar equation? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Equation with scalars on the left and right hand
        sides.</span></li>

    added or subtracted.</li>
  <li>If a scalar is multiplied times a vector, is the result another vector or
    another scalar? <span id="ans">another vector</span></li>
  <li>What is a resultant&#x201d;? <span id="ans">The sum of 2 or more
    vectors.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>What does it mean to say that vector addition is commutative and
    associative? 
    <ul>
      <li id="ans">Commutative &#x2013; A+B=B+A. associative (A+B)+C =
      A+(B+C).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What does commutativity mean for the order in which you add vectors? 
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">The order doesn&#x2019;t matter.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: Unit vectors are an important concept we will focus
    on heavily in the course</span> 
    <p>What is a unit vector? How are they represented? </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span id="ans">Special vector that has magnitude = 1 and no units:

        construction.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Understand Figure 2.10 to understand the parallelogram rule.</li>
  <li><span id="prob">NOTE: The word "translate" used here is a technical term
    that has a special meaning for vectors which is "to move the vector
    graphically (on the page) such that its length and direction are
    preserved"</span></li>
  <li>The tail-to-head geometric construction involves arranging 2 vectors
    graphically in what way?
